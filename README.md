Objective

The goal of this project is to create a web-based dashboard that simulates and visualizes Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and mobility management for 4G wireless networks. The dashboard is designed to be interactive and user-friendly while providing key features such as real-time simulation of QoS changes, handover simulation between network cells.

Key Features

1. QoS Metrics Simulation:

Displays key QoS parameters such as Latency, Jitter, and Packet Loss.

Provides a button to simulate changes in these metrics.

Visualizes the metrics using an interactive line chart powered by Chart.js.



2. Mobility Management Simulation:

Simulates handover between different network cells (e.g., Cell A, Cell B, etc.).

Updates the current cell dynamically upon triggering a handover event.

---

Technologies Used

HTML: For the structure of the web dashboard.

CSS: For styling the interface, including responsive design and dark mode.

JavaScript: For adding interactivity, simulating QoS changes, managing mobility handover.

Chart.js: For visualizing QoS metrics with dynamic charts.

---

File Structure

index.html: Contains the main layout and elements of the dashboard.

styles.css: Defines the styles for the interface

app.js: Handles the core logic for QoS simulation, mobility management

Project Workflow

1. Simulate QoS Metrics:

Click the "Simulate QoS Change" button to generate random values for latency, jitter, and packet loss.

The values are displayed and updated on the chart in real-time.



2. Simulate Mobility Handover:

Click the "Simulate Handover" button to switch between different network cells.

This project is designed to give a practical demonstration of 4G network concepts
